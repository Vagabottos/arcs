## Editorializations

In order to make the rulebook text fit more cleanly into this format, a number of non-material
editorialization liberties have been taken. They have been itemized below for your convenience.

- Because page numbers have no meaning in this app, page numbers have been replaced with specific
  rule reference links.
- Some top-level sections have been reordered so as to make them adjacent to more similar sections.
  For example, "Other Actions" was moved next to "Standard Actions", and "Ending a Chapter" was
  moved next to "Playing a Chapter". This ordering serves better as a rules reference, whereas the
  print ordering serves better as a tool for learning the game.
- The component lists for base game and expansion have been combined. For example, Guild cards
  appear in the same bullet, itemized between base game and expansion.
- For aesthetic reasons, the component counts have been moved from the component "title" to the
  component descriptions.
- Law of Root style "names" have been added to each rule. As in Root, these names have no rules
  significance and merely serve to help the reader scan the document. In cases where the rulebook
  defines a term (such as Ransack the Court), the term has been preserved verbatim as the rule's
  name.
- Some "To do X, resolve the following steps:"-style linking phrases have been added to improve
  readability in this format.
- "Base game" and "campaign" qualifiers have been added in situations where it would otherwise now
  be ambiguous. For example, the section describing Leaders & Lore setup now specifies that it
  replaces particular steps in the "base game setup", rather than just "setup".
- Because this app has no "back cover of the rulebook", the QR code for the rules video has been
  replaced with the the same link featured at https://ledergames.com/products/arcs.
- Some linking words have been removed, such as "finally" in the Truce Law rule, or "also" in the
  Movement Law rule, because they read poorly when the rules are expressed in this format.
- Some pronouns have been replaced with the nouns to which they refer, in cases where the new
  format made it unclear. For example, "They cannot be scrapped." -> "Event cards cannot be
  scrapped."
- In at least one case, "as described above" has been replaced with a reference to the actual rule.
- The most naughtily-reordered section is "Declaring an Ambition", which now more significantly
  emphasizes the actual thing you do when you declare an ambition before explaining how to declare
  an ambition while leading. It was otherwise unclear how to organize this section into bullets.
- In some cases, exclamation marks have been replaced with periods if they appear in standalone
  rules. Fun has been preserved in the more conversational "pretext" passages. Previous Laws only
  use exclamation points in italicized clarifications, but it is too radical to "downgrade" rules
  to clarifications, even if they appear not to be normative.
- Added flagship setup (from back of flagship board).

Other than the exceptions described above, this document is identical to the rulebook+errata at a
sentence atom level.
